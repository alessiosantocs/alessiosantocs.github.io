First iteration on Cinnamon, a health and wellness companion app. It digests quantified self data to give birth to a wonderful algorithm generated abstract plant. We developed a prototype and this awesome landing page to gather users' feedback. 

The peculiarity of this project is that it starts from the bottom and slowly brings you to the top with beautiful animations and transitions. I just love it.

#### Role

I worked with an IDEO NY director to develop this beautiful concept and implemented all the animations into the website. Complex SVGs + Css3 techniques, javascript to handle interactions.
