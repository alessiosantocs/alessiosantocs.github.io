A redesign of a dental practice's existing wordpress website. ADEC dental practice is the top destination for dental care in Milan, Italy.

They take extreme care of their patients. This is an ongoing - work in progress - project where my goal is to communicate ADEC's admirable values into their website through a process of learning, iterating and testing.

#### Role
I am involved in this project 360Â°. I follow every aspect of the online experience of the user. I developed the theme and worked on SEO optimization and much more.

I have provided strong guidance to my client - Matteo - to make him better understand how his users interact with the website and what we should change over time to make their exp awesome!
